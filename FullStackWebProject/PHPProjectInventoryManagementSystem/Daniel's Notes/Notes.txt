Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav">
 <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate
 navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be
used to define different parts of a web page:  

    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>

[Creating a Log In Form Page Using HTML, CSS and PHP 2:]

Design will guide us Also make own folder for imgs
then make html and css other files. Get an image for background

Definition and Usage
When used together with the <label> element, the for attribute
specifies which form element a label is bound to.

When used together with the <output> element, the for attribute 
specifies the relationship between the result
of the calculation, and the elements used in the calculation.

The HTML <form> element can contain one or more
make folders for css


/*div.container*/

/*.container{
    display: none;
} This will make everything inside container disappear*/


/*.container{
    background: url('/images/login-background.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
    background-size: cover; */
    /*background: url('../images/login-background.jpg')*/
    /*center*/
/* } */

/*
::after
In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the 
last child of the selected element. It is often used to
add cosmetic content to an element with the content
property. It is inline by default. */

/*.dead-link::after {
  content: url('../../media/warning.svg');
  display: inline-block;
  width: 12px;
  height: 12px;
}

.topic-games::after {
  content: '🎮 ';
}

.topic-weather::before {
  content: '⛅ ';
}

The value of said property is adjusted automatically
according to the content or the context of the element.

For example, a block-level element with height: auto
will grow taller as it contains more text. For another
example, a block element with margin: 0 auto will have
the left and right margins increased until it becomes
centered along the y-axis of the viewport.

CSS introduced the ::after notation (with two colons)
to distinguish pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements.
For backward compatibility, browsers also accept
:after, introduced earlier.
It really depends on the property you give the value
to, different properties behave differently depending
on the content and context.
*/

/*:: = pseudo elements : = psuedo classes*/

/*here use tag instead of a class*/

   border: 2px solid #fff;
/*Notice instead of sumoning other properties
    their values are summoned here, like the solid
    is border-width, then border-color after*/

/*This property is specified as a comma-separated list of shadows.*/
/*Look it up further as theres more into this:  color | offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius

    /*Text Shadow simulating Text Border is my addition*/
    /*-webkit-text-stroke: 2px #fff;*/
    /*Read and comprehend this, look up text-shadow*/

A modern css reset
https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/
Reset style sheet
A reset stylesheet is a collection of CSS rules used
to clear the browser's default formatting of HTML
elements, removing potential inconsistencies between
different browsers. It also prevents developers from
unknowingly relying on the browser default styling and
force them to be explicit about the styling they want to
apply on the page

div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

So position relative, I get it now
With this the normal position is where its standing
and it moves away from it to go to right if right is set
or it goes the other way around, so it moves away from
where its normally positioned.

So lets say if it was in a div or something:
It will move inside that div and relative to that
div, so where it's position in that div, it moves
from there. Still confusing but i think it sounds right

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>


An element with position: relative; is positioned relative
to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted
away from its normal position. Other content will not be
adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. 


So here's the logic behint postion: relative
if its inside a div exactly it will include it will work
or move relative to the div, so it becomes part of div
Still not sure though, yeah...

Also, the body element has its own padding, so I tested it
The padding of body will be ignored by an element like p
that has a styling position: relative. So no padding

While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are

> is the child combinator, sometimes mistakenly called the
direct descendant combinator.1

That means the selector div > p.some_class only matches
paragraphs of .some_class that are nested directly inside a
div, and not any paragraphs that are nested further within.
This implies that every element matching div > p.some_class
necessarily also matches div p.some_class, with the descendant
combinator (space), so the two are understandably often confused.

You know, you can just make a documentation format like this:
Take the keywords worth noting and everything close to that,
Place it at top, then use ctrl + find to find the documentation
of it here, even go and make a special code for it and match it.
Then along with the explanation or documentation add a code that
perfectly encapsulates or conveys how it work. Here's a look:

CSS Selectors = @#154321
Div Element = @#563231
CSS combinators = @#756331
auto value = @#485674

@#756331 :

[Create An Admin Dashboard Sidebar Menu 5:]
100% can be 100% of the height of anything. For example, 
if I have a parent div that's 1000px tall, and a child div
that is at 100% height, then that child div could
theoretically be much taller than the height of the
viewport, or much smaller than the height of the viewport,
even though that div is set at 100% height.

If I instead make that child div set at 100vh, then
it'll only fill up 100% of the height of the viewport,
and not necessarily the parent div.

Create a Clickable Dropdown

Create a dropdown menu that appears when the user clicks on a button.
Step 1) Add HTML:
 <div class="dropdown">
  <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">Dropdown</button>
  <div id="myDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
    <a href="#">Link 1</a>
    <a href="#">Link 2</a>
    <a href="#">Link 3</a>
  </div>
</div> 

Example Explained

Use any element to open the dropdown menu, e.g. a <button>, <a> or <p> element.

Use a container element (like <div>) to create the dropdown menu and add the dropdown links inside it.

Wrap a <div> element around the button and the <div> to position the dropdown menu correctly with CSS.

Step 2) Add CSS:

 /* Dropdown Button */
.dropbtn {
  background-color: #3498DB;
  color: white;
  padding: 16px;
  font-size: 16px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* Dropdown button on hover & focus */
.dropbtn:hover, .dropbtn:focus {
  background-color: #2980B9;
}

/* The container <div> - needed to position the dropdown content */
.dropdown {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
}

/* Dropdown Content (Hidden by Default) */
.dropdown-content {
  display: none;
  position: absolute;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  min-width: 160px;
  box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Links inside the dropdown */
.dropdown-content a {
  color: black;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: block;
}

/* Change color of dropdown links on hover */
.dropdown-content a:hover {background-color: #ddd;}

/* Show the dropdown menu (use JS to add this class to the .dropdown-content container when the user clicks on the dropdown button) */
.show {display:block;} 

Example Explained

We have styled the dropdown button with a background-color, padding, hover effect, etc.

The .dropdown class uses position:relative, which is needed when we want the dropdown content to be placed right below the dropdown button (using position:absolute).

The .dropdown-content class holds the actual dropdown menu. It is hidden by default, and will be displayed on hover (see below). Note the min-width is set to 160px. Feel free to change this. Tip: If you want the width of the dropdown content to be as wide as the dropdown button, set the width to 100% (and overflow:auto to enable scroll on small screens).

Instead of using a border, we have used the box-shadow property to make the dropdown menu look like a "card". We also use z-index to place the dropdown in front of other elements.

Step 3) Add JavaScript:

function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("myDropdown").classList.toggle("show");
}

// Close the dropdown menu if the user clicks outside of it
window.onclick = function(event) {
  if (!event.target.matches('.dropbtn')) {
    var dropdowns = document.getElementsByClassName("dropdown-content");
    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < dropdowns.length; i++) {
      var openDropdown = dropdowns[i];
      if (openDropdown.classList.contains('show')) {
        openDropdown.classList.remove('show');
      }
    }
  }
} 

Right-aligned dropdown

Aligned Dropdown Content

Use float: right on the dropdown class to float the dropdown menu to the right, and right:0 on the dropdown-content if you want the dropdown content to go from right to left.

We, will work with the database here:
Remember that to use local host or server place
the code files in htdocs inside xampp folder
to look it up do localhost/then here the name

XAMPP PHP installation

To make your html files work with sql and php, turn it into .php files when in htdocs

From here on out, do exactly what is asked of you, and don't add any more!
That problem with the background: url was a pain in the fuckin ass

The tutorial guy has two xampp apps/folder? what?

Here is all you need to know about relative file paths:

Starting with “/” returns to the root directory and starts there
Starting with “../” moves one directory backwards and starts there
Starting with “../../” moves two directories backwards and starts there (and so on…)
To move forward, just start with the first subdirectory and keep moving forward

With php and editing it, or when using server, xampp and stuff

Do Ctrl + F5 as a real refresh to truly refresh
Or in our limited keyboard's case, do Ctrl + Fn + F5
Probably because of cache and stuff

Either this or move to WAMP

We want the homepage.php to be the first page to go in
So the xampp of server/web will first look for that if you
make homepage.php into index.php, which we'll do right now

And then all you need to do now is open the folder and it will
open that first, without adding /homepage.php or /index.php there

With programming keep attention to the locations
Location of folders and files
The location the codes are pointing to
Which file the code is pointing at
Keep mind of extension, servers, local and others

So if you turned the files from html to php,
Find the anchors and change the links its pointing at

xampp acts like a server in our local machine

Click the users table so you can find the insert tab on top
there you can insert manually without php or webpage

you can set the date time to or just use auto value it has
once you're done, hit go on lower right corner

The double arrow operator, =>, is used as an access mechanism for
arrays. This means that what is on the left side of it will have a
corresponding value of what is on the right side of it in array
context. This can be used to set values of any acceptable type into
a corresponding index of an array. The index can be associative
(string based) or numeric.

$myArray = array(
    0 => 'Big',
    1 => 'Small',
    2 => 'Up',
    3 => 'Down'
);

The object operator, ->, is used in object scope to access methods
and properties of an object. It’s meaning is to say that what is on
the right of the operator is a member of the object instantiated into
the variable on the left side of the operator. Instantiated is the
key term here.

// Create a new instance of MyObject into $obj
$obj = new MyObject();
// Set a property in the $obj object called thisProperty
$obj->thisProperty = 'Fred';
// Call a method of the $obj object named getProperty
$obj->getProperty();



=> is used in associative array key value assignment. Take a look at:

http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php.

-> is used to access an object method or property. Example: $obj->method().

When the left part is an object instance, you use ->. Otherwise, you use ::.

This means that -> is mostly used to access instance members (though it can also be used to access static members, such usage is discouraged), while :: is usually used to access static members (though in a few special cases, it's used to access instance members).

In general, :: is used for scope resolution, and it may have either a class name, parent, self, or (in PHP 5.3) static to its left. parent refers to the scope of the superclass of the class where it's used; self refers to the scope of the class where it's used; static refers to the "called scope" (see late static bindings).

The rule is that a call with :: is an instance call if and only if:

    the target method is not declared as static and
    there is a compatible object context at the time of the call, meaning these must be true:
        the call is made from a context where $this exists and
        the class of $this is either the class of the method being called or a subclass of it.

This means

In other words this means that the elements of the array will be retrieved inside the loop as $value. Notice that you can specify also this syntax:

foreach ($array as $key => $value) {}

In both ways the vars $key and $value will exists inside the foreach and will correspond to the 'current' element of the array.


foreach ¶

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

The foreach construct provides an easy way to iterate over arrays. foreach works only on arrays and objects, and will issue an error when you

[How To Update Data in MySQL Database using AJAX/JQuery/JavaScript PHP BootstrapDialog 10:]

First, realize that AJAX is a concept, not a specific technology or API. Second, look at what
AJAX stands for: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. The asynchronous part has never been lost.
If anything, it's grown and now we have things like promises and async/await.

People moved away from XML (and to JSON). In the past, you would have used XMLHttpRequest
to make a server request. Now, most people now just use fetch and return JSON from the server.

Remember that the tutorial guy and you use different ide, browser, and the time difference make
some of his points obsolete, so keep that in mind.

This below pops up, even though he didn't get it, because the tutorial was years ago
[DOM] Input elements should have autocomplete attributes (suggested: "current-password"): (More info: https://goo.gl/9p2vKq) <input type=​"password" class=​"appFormInput" id=​"password" name=​"password">​


Also firefox doesn't outright show what it got, but google does with this in regard:
if(classList.contains('updateUser')){
    e.preventDefault();
    
    //Get data. It will target and get that data?
    //This will be inside one tr anyway so it'll target closest tr with td equal to that class, td.firstName example
    firstName = targetElement.closest('tr').querySelector('td.firstName');
    lastName = targetElement.closest('tr').querySelector('td.lastName');
    email = targetElement.closest('tr').querySelector('td.email');
    
    //this pulls out information related to that td next to class
    console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
}


Results in Chrome:
<td class="firstName"> 
<td class="lastName"> 
<td class="email">


Results in firefox:
<td class="firstName">Chaeyoung</td>
<td class="lastName">Son</td>
<td class="email">sonchaeyoung@gmail.com</td>

[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) | Create Tables Using MySQL Command in phpMyAdmin 11:]
At the moment only have one database table
ERD is A
type of structural deiagram for use in databases design.
import tables and stuff before that we design entity relation program

it contains different symbols and connectors that visualize two important information: the major
entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships among these entities.

data entities
check the notebook for sql
ER Diagrams in notebook SQL:

Go use lucid.app web for designing database if you want

Products table:

column        values
id            PK
product_name  String
created_by    FK
created_at    DateTime
updated_at    DateTime

ERD or Entity RelationShip Diagram are like Work FLows in programmings


inputing manually in sql
mayasql query

In SQL we made a relation
check products table we have primary and an index
gold key primary the id
silver key index the created_by

check structure > relation view of products table
index is then connected with id from table users

in workflow thing lucid, you can change column of logos
in relation to if they are completed or done with green color

In, foreign key constraint creation page
just look at the layout and you can imagine what it does

You can check SQL documentation.
Also it's possible to make a table by making commands
using PHP AND PDO 

The foreign key inside supplier relates to the id
in users table

We'll now use mySQL query instead
and make simple query to make a table
Go at SQL tab inside of database

You can manually add a column in phpmyadmin
just below the structure.

You can leave constraint text Input box with nothing
it can make its own name automatically

Index key = Foreign key

So four new tables in total have been added.

[How To Create Multi Level Drop down Navigation Menu using CSS HTML JS - PART ONE 12:]
 

 
 /*!important prioritizes this, cause theres hierchy or order of prioritation*/
    padding-left: 25px !important;
  
a.subMenuLink{
    /*!important prioritizes this, cause theres hierchy or */
    padding-left: 25px !important;
    padding-top: 10px !important;
    padding-bottom: 10px !important;
    text-transform: none;
    
}

CSS The !important Rule
What is !important?

The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

Let us look at an example:
Example
#myid {
  background-color: blue;
}

.myclass {
  background-color: gray;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}

Example Explained

In the example above. all three paragraphs will get a red background color,
even though the ID selector and the class selector have a higher specificity.
 The !important rule overrides the background-color property in both cases.


ul.subMenus{
    /*This removes the dropdown bullet point signs*/
    list-style-type: none;
    background: #c26a80;
    /*Had to add below this cause submenu has gap without this*/
    margin-left: -40px;
    /*This property below will make this part disappear,
      you can't even find it with inspect webdevtool*/
    display: none;
}

/*You can see the elements in left side of webdevtool
  hover over it and youll see which covers which, usefu*/

/*This is the element it targets*/
/*<i class="fa fa-angle-up mainMenuIconArrow"></i>*/
i.mainMenuIconArrow{
    /*This causes the icon to go right*/
    float: right;
    margin-top: 5px;
    /*This property below was supposed to inherit from above
      this one ul.dashboard_menu_lists li.liMainMenu a i
      The !important cut that ties*/
    font-size: 20px !important;
}

[How To Insert Data Into MySQL Database Using PHP PDO | Adding Products To Database 14:]
Lots of script changes and seperation in this chapter so keep your eyes peeled for changes

So apparently the method to displaying or placing images in database
is with varchar so we're probably just linking images

We're going to make add.php dynamic

It's better to look at proper documentation instead of just the internet people answers

Woo, were done, that was confusing as hell, you got to re-read the codes to fully understandably






[Inventory System | How To Upload Files and Images into Database using PHP $_FILES 15:]

Ok next part
Also just noticed that scroll CSS Property only works in Chrome and not firefox

Click xampp > config > php
find file_uploads
should be set at ON value is ON


Look up for=""  attribute again 
The for attribute associates the label with a control element, as defined in the
description of label in the HTML 4.01 spec. This implies, among other things,
that when the label element receives focus (e.g. by being clicked on), it passes
the focus on to its associated control.

[How To Delete Data from MySQL Database Using jQuery AJAX PHP MYSQL BootstrapDialog 17:]


We deleted the  show-users.php file, heres the code within it:

<?php

//include makes it so anything in 'connection.php' can be used here
include('connection.php');

//prepare a function/objectfunction/method from $conn from connection.php
//which has the PDO class, inside are placed in parameters
//we specified that it be ordered by column created_at at descending
//below specifier of order by desc stuff sets it from newly created to oldest made
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC");
//Then below, the execute line executes it
//$stmt can use PDO function because it was set equal to $conn?
$stmt->execute();
//This below line makes it into an array, so its organized, check on var_masterpiece
//If Fetch::assoc is not used it will be showed as indexed in var_dump, tutorial guy said
//Basically organizes it, if not its unorganized used var_dump to see
$stmt->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

return $stmt->fetchAll();
//Below code are for checking, like console.log
//var_dump($stmt->fetchAll());
//die;


?>



What I'll write here is true for jQuery events,
For vanilla javascript events read @T.J. Crowder comment at the bottom of the answer

return false inside a callback prevents the default behaviour. For example, in a submit event, it doesn't submit the form.

return false also stops bubbling, so the parents of the element won't know the event occurred.

return false is equivalent to event.preventDefault() + event.stopPropagation()

And of course, all code that exists after the return xxx line won't be executed. (as with all programming languages I know)


Its weird with google chrome the scroll appears, but in firefox it dashboard_menu_lists

also in chrome the images doesnt overflow, but in firefox it still overflows

    //Is it turning it back into an int? Cause data is being filtered all the time
    $user_id = (int) $data['user_id'];
    $first_name = $data['f_name'];
    $last_name = $data['l_name'];

    //var_dump($user_id); you left this, and this stopped the alert from working, it interfered

    //We copied this setup code below from add.php. So some notes might not make sense
    try {
        $command = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id={$user_id}";
        //var_dump($command);
        //die;
        //I don't know what int(17) string(29) correspond to
        //int(17) string(29) "DELETE FROM users WHERE id=17"

        //Command like how we would have typed it in phpmyadmin
        //exec is probably a method or function inside PDO which is in $conn

                this one code line below is a mystery but it instantly runs the moment page is opens
                which in turn runs the this.initialize function
                (new script()).initialize();

                Note that this line of code below works also
                new script().initialize();




        Look at the code sequence below

        Note that not sure what json_encode us for
         $products = include('database/show.php');
         $products = json_encode($products);

         is above this file, at the php section above
         the php $products then gets turned into a var products
         in script or javascript below here

         then the products got attached to .foreach method which
         then uses the product as its parameter to be used inside it
         product then gets .id and other columns inside products which
         represents a table in the database. += is you know this
         its adding 


        <script>
            var products = <?= $products ?>;

                this.initialize = function(){
                    this.registerEvents();
                    this.renderProductOptions();
                },

                this.renderProductOptions = function(){
                    console.log(products);

                    products.foreach((product) =>{
                        optionHtml += '<option value="'+ product.id +'">'+ product.product_name +'</option>';
                    });

                    productOptions.replace('INSERTPRODUCTHERE', optionHtml);
                },

    productOptions then gets the .replace method which inside says INSERTPRODUCTHERE
    inside productOptions gets replaced by optionHtml, and that foreach runs that

    This line of code belows does exactly what it looks like
    productOptions = productOptions.replace('INSERTPRODUCTHERE', optionHtml);


                        This below block of code makes it so
                        when you click add another product button
                        you'll get a new line where you can select product

                        // Add New product order Event
                        if(targetElement.id === 'orderProductBtn'){
                            let orderProductListsContainer = document.getElementById('orderProductLists');

                            orderProductListsContainer.innerHTML += '\
                                <div class="orderProductRow">\
                                    '+ productOptions +'\
                                    <div class="suppliersRows"></div>\
                                </div>';

                        }





This code block below when element with that class is clicked and changed
which is the option thing where you pick the product. 

document.addEventListener('change', function(e){
    targetElement = e.target; // Target element
    classList = targetElement.classList;


    // Add suppliers row on product option change
    if(classList.contains('productNameSelect')){
        alert('change');

    }
});


if(classList.contains('productNameSelect')){
    let pid = targetElement.value;
    console.log(pid);

}

this will log out the id of the product selected



document.addEventListener('change', function(e){
    targetElement = e.target; 
    classList = targetElement.classList;

    if(classList.contains('productNameSelect')){
        let pid = targetElement.value;

        if(!pid.length){
            console.log('no-id');
        }
    }
});


the if(!pid.length)

means it will run if theres no pid.length
I don't know exactly what the length method is for
just !pid works but lets just follow, might be a precution

it also uses a new file called get-product-suppliers.php

                            }, 'json');



var vm = this;

I think I got what this line means now
the this keyword goes inside vm which then makes the vm in to this
so this line below
vm.renderSupplierRows(suppliers);
means this below
this.renderSupplierRows


Everytime the below code block gets run, something is added to the counter

                                            var counter = 0; //This one is set above


                                orderProductListsContainer.innerHTML += '\
                                <div class="orderProductRow">\
                                    '+ productOptions +'\
                                    <div class="suppliersRows" id="supplierRows_'+ counter +'"></div>\
                                </div>';

                                //The counter will increment
                                counter++;

Look up this element attribute:
data-



    if(targetElement.id === 'orderProductBtn'){
        let orderProductListsContainer = document.getElementById('orderProductLists');

        orderProductListsContainer.innerHTML += '\
            <div class="orderProductRow">\
                '+ productOptions +'\
                <div class="suppliersRows" id="supplierRows_'+ counter +'" data-counter="'+ counter +'"></div>\
            </div>';

        counter++;
    }


dataset is related to data-counter=""?
console.log(targetElement.closest('div.orderProductRow').querySelector('.suppliersRows').dataset.counter);
                            //targetElement.closest('div.orderProductRow');


This is basically a huge specifier to grab a very specific part
let counterId = targetElement.closest('div.orderProductRow').querySelector('.suppliersRows').dataset.counter


This code below need += or else it'll only show one supplier
suppliers.forEach((supplier) => {
    supplierRows += '\


                    //Append to Container
                    let supplierRowContainer = document.getElementById('supplierRows_' + counterId);
                    supplierRowContainer.innerHTML = supplierRows;


so this keyword is an object thing
and we set an object
you know that new script()

You know that math thing were the numbers are executed first
if its within ()
That must be why new script is inside ()
It gets run first then follows the .initialize() method
These are just speculations


The class is here so when its summoned it will attach to css even though its not initially in the page
                                    <input type="number" class="appFormInput" class="orderProductQty" id="quantity" placeholder="Enter Quantity..." name="quantity"/>\

                                    <input type="number" class="appFormInput orderProductQty" id="quantity" placeholder="Enter Quantity..." name="order[quantity]['+ supplier.id +']"/>\

Above something about array and stuff

name="order[quantity]['+ supplier.id +']
from above to bottom, he said adding extra array
name="order[quantity]['+ supplier.id +'][]

Then it got modified again to turn like this below
name="order[quantity][]['+ supplier.id +']

Then he said more array and this below was made
name="order[quantity][][]['+ supplier.id +']


<input type="number" class="appFormInput orderProductQty" id="quantity" placeholder="Enter Quantity..." name="quantity['+ supplier.id +']"/>\

<select name="products[]" id="product_name"  class="productNameSelect">\

This two combo makes this
Now what this array line means is that 0 has value of 40 which is the id of Dua a product name and then in quantity array theres 1 and 4
there at the beginning because thats the id number of those respective suppliers from supplier table 1 is nestle and 4 is JYPEE
array(2) { ["products"]=> array(1) { [0]=> string(2) "40" } ["quantity"]=> array(2) { [1]=> string(3) "222" [4]=> string(3) "222" } }

from above changed to below
                                    <input type="number" class="appFormInput orderProductQty" id="quantity" placeholder="Enter Quantity..." name="quantity[]['+ supplier.id +']"/>\
the above makes this prints out this
array(2) { ["products"]=> array(1) { [0]=> string(2) "17" } ["quantity"]=> array(2) { [0]=> array(1) { [1]=> string(4) "1111" } [1]=> array(1) { [4]=> string(4) "4444" } } }

                        <select name="products[]" id="product_name"  class="productNameSelect">\


the counter affects the quantity array number since we have the remove() feature
So if initially you made 4 forms
then you deleted the first 2 and added another 2
the result would be in that situation is 
3 4 5 6

the first two got removed since we removed it

$post_data = $_POST;
$products = $post_data['products'];

products relates to the name="" attribute
containing products which also happens to have []

it gets produced and placed inside a form that has POST
and so when submitted it gets sent to save-order;

Its complicated but don't worry you'll get it once you read it


this following code fixes the situation where 
if you remove a add product row, it removes the past integer numbers
so the 3456 and the removed 12
This below fixes it so it becomes 0123 etc again

$qty = array_values($post_data['quantity']);

var_dump($qty);

This below  codes makes the following after It

$post_data = $_POST;
$products = $post_data['products'];
$qty = array_values($post_data['quantity']);

$post_data_arr = [];

foreach($products as $key => $pid) {

        echo $pid . ' ' . $sid . ' ' . $qty . '<br/>';
    }
}

var_dump($post_data_arr);
die;


?>

the above code results to this following:

17 1 111
17 4 111
41 1 1111
41 2 1111
41 4 1111
16 1 111
16 2 111
array(3) { [17]=> array(2) { [1]=> string(3) "111" [4]=> string(3) "111" } [41]=> array(3) { [1]=> string(4) "1111" [2]=> string(4) "1111" [4]=> string(4) "1111" } [16]=> array(2) { [1]=> string(3) "111" [2]=> string(3) "111" } }


This is a general technique you need to think about
If you can think that solution, it probably exists
So if you ask how can I turn this array into a string
theres probably a solution or method or whatever that can do that

I'll screenshot this so you can check it on screenshot folder

I think this line of code below so on select sql command batch column pas pulled
I guess for each batch pulled there will be run? and the extra [] holds the contents 
related to batch? but the = $purchase_order; is a tad bit confusing
            $data[$purchase_order['batch']][] = $purchase_order;


The code sequence below, we've seen this before or used before
Its covering an entire code block and producing it. New this will produce each one for each batch pulled

                                            $data = [];
                                            foreach($purchase_orders as $purchase_order){
                                                $data[$purchase_order['batch']][] = $purchase_order;

With this the batch will respond to the batches pulled
                                        <?php

                                            <table>

it only displayed the batch but not the values attached to that batch, why?
maybe cause its not specified? Not sure


                                        <?php
                                            foreach($data as $batch_id => $batch_pos){
                                        ?>

                                        <div class="poList">

Change at top

foreach start at the beggining arrays start at zero so we add
1 to $index and the rest pulls their own column equivalent to the array id they are in
Also note that at the view-order.php page the one at the top usually is the latest ordered


    <tbody>
        <?php
            foreach($batch_pos as $index => $batch_po) {
        ?>
        <tr>
            <td> <?= $index + 1 ?> </td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['product_name']?></td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['quantity_ordered']?></td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['supplier_name']?></td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['status']?></td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['first_name' . ' ' . 'last_name']?></td>
            <td><?= $batch_po['created_at']?></td>
        </tr>
        <?php
        }
        ?>
    </tbody>

THis code below relates to the css specifier that it pulles
so if the column is arrived it will change css, you can see it here on code below

<td><?= $batch_po['supplier_name']?></td>
<td><span class="po-badge po-badge-<?= $batch_po['status'] ?>"><?= $batch_po['status']?><span></td>
<td><?= $batch_po['first_name'] . ' ' . $batch_po['last_name']?></td>

.po-badge{
    padding: 4px 6px;
    border: 1px solid;
}

.po-badge-ORDERED{
    background: #ff938e;
    border-color: #556455;
}

.po-badge-ARRIVED{
    background: #b5ebb5;
    border-color: green;
}

he changed the code, heres the new set changes

.po-badge{
    padding: 4px 6px;
    border: 1px solid;
}

.po-badge-pending{
    background: #ff938e;
    border-color: #556455;
}

.po-badge-complete{
    background: #b5ebb5;
    border-color: green;
}

the values status column holds now are either complete or pending











[Updating Purchase Order - Convert HTML Table To Object with JavaScript - PART I 29:]

So, it turns out that we made a mistake naming column quantity_recieve 
it should have been quantity_received so fuck, hopefully this doesnt mess things up
although I checked with find anything else named recieve and only three turns up and
we fixed and changed that


data- attribute seems to be important
    <button class="appBtn updatePoBtn" data-id="">Update</button>

what this below lines mean is that $batch_pos as $index and then $batch_po pulls out from it
which is different from -> which just pulls out a method or fucnction to use
foreach($batch_pos as $index => $batch_po) {

We finally fixed the hole Previously
now when we add order the status placed isnt ORDERED
it now prints out pending. change made in save-order.php

po stands for purchase order

            // Insert to database.  
    
            $values = [
                'supplier' => $sid,
                'product' => $pid,
                'quantity_ordered' => $qty,
                'status' => 'pending',
                'batch' => $batch,
                'created_by' => $_SESSION['user']['id'],
                'updated_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
                'created_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
            ];


            this.registerEvents = function(){
                document.addEventListener('click', function(e){
                    targetElement = e.target;

                        pName = targetElement.dataset.pname;
                        
This code block above just test if update button works


product = document.querySelector('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_product').text;
above changed to this below, since keeping .text would result into undefined
product = document.querySelector('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_product').innerText;



            this.registerEvents = function(){

            this.registerEvents = function(){
                document.addEventListener('click', function(e){
                    targetElement = e.target; // Target element
                    classList = targetElement.classList;

                    if(classList.contains('updatePoBtn')){
                        e.preventDefault(); 

                        batchNumberContainer = 'container-' + targetElement.dataset.id;

                        // Get all purchase order product records
                        productList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_product');
                        qtyOrderedList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_qty_ordered');
                        qtyReceivedList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_qty_received');
                        supplierList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_qty_supplier');
                        statusList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + batchNumberContainer + ' .po_qty_status');

                        poListsArr = [];
                        for(i=0; i<productList.length; i++){
                            poListsArr.push({
                                name: productList[i].innerText,
                                qtyOrdered: qtyOrderedList[i].innerText,
                                qtyReceived: qtyReceivedList[i].innerText,
                                supplier: supplierList[i].innerText,
                                status: statusList[i].innerText,
                            });
                        }

                        productList.forEach((product, key) => {
                            poListsArr[key]['product'] = product.innerText;
                        });

                        console.log(poListsArr);
                        return;

                        pName = targetElement.dataset.name;

This code above will result in this console.log when you click update button

Array(4) [ {…}, {…}, {…}, {…} ]
​
0: Object { name: "Dua", qtyOrdered: "3123123", supplier: "JYPEEE", … }
​
1: Object { name: "TWICE Jacket World Tour", qtyOrdered: "123123", supplier: "JYPEEE", … }
​
2: Object { name: "Dua", qtyOrdered: "12312", supplier: "Nestle", … }
​
3: Object { name: "TWICE Jacket World Tour", qtyOrdered: "1212", supplier: "Nestle", … }
​
length: 4


Again I think this below line of code means
If truthy go with left (selected) if falsy go right ('')
So if things arent met

<option value="pending" '+ (poList.status == 'pending' ? 'selected' : '') +'>pending</option>\

                        poListHtml += '</tbody></table>';


</tbody> and </table> is outside because its like that

.updateInputStyle{
    width: 100%;
}

I added this code block style above to fix overflow hidden for quantity

This below is related to the ids in order_product table

                                    alert('Will be deleting');
                                    $.ajax({

From above code changed to below code

                                    formTableContainer = 'formTable_' + batchNumber;

                                    // Get all purchase order product records
                                    qtyReceivedList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + formTableContainer + ' .po_qty_received');
                                    statusList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + formTableContainer + ' .po_qty_status');
                                    rowIds = document.querySelectorAll('#' + formTableContainer + ' .po_qty_row_id');

                                    poListsArrForm = [];
                                    for(i=0; i<qtyReceivedList.length; i++){
                                        poListsArrForm.push({
                                            qtyReceived: qtyReceivedList[i].value,
                                            status: statusList[i].value,
                                            id: rowIds[i].value
                                        });
                                    }

                                    console.log(poListsArrForm);
                                    return;

                                    alert('Will be deleting');
                                    $.ajax({
                                    method: 'POST',
                                    data: {


We only kept the only one that needed changing

The line of code below has hold input so we add input here
qtyReceivedList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + formTableContainer + ' .po_qty_received input');

Array(4) [ {…}, {…}, {…}, {…} ]
​
0: Object { qtyReceived: "", status: "pending", id: "51" }
​
1: Object { qtyReceived: "", status: "pending", id: "49" }
​
2: Object { qtyReceived: "", status: "pending", id: "52" }
​
3: Object { qtyReceived: "", status: "pending", id: "50" }
​
length: 4

the input we added in here:
qtyReceivedList = document.querySelectorAll('#' + formTableContainer + ' .po_qty_received input');

And that makes this, not make undefined
0: Object { qtyReceived: "", status: "pending", id: "51" }

                                        data: poListsArrForm,

                                        success: function(data){

keeping this is bad:
data: poListsArrForm,
we need an object so we turned it into this:
                                        data: {
                                            data: poListsArrForm
                                        },
and then this
                                    $.ajax({
                                        method: 'POST',
                                        data: {
                                            payload: poListsArrForm
                                        },


    $payload = $_POST['payload'];
    var_dump($payload);

    pay load is kind of like a variable atteched to the post

Think of this things are switching and passing between objects, arrays (Maybe some other data types)

This code below can make deductions and proccess better in the database, on on that specific table

    foreach($purchase_orders as $po){
        $received = (int) $po['qtyReceived'];
        $status = $po['status'];
        $row_id = $po['id'];
        $qty_ordered = (int) $po['qtyOrdered'];

        $qty_remaining = $qty_ordered - $received;

        $sql = "UPDATE order_product 
                    SET
                    quantity_received =?, status =?, quantity_remaining=?
                    WHERE id =?";

        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
        $stmt->execute([$received, $status, $qty_remaining, $row_id]);
    }

    }
?>

Fixed the password problem, like I fixed the sidebar length problem, and everything else he left out
Note that query got modified in this update

        if($stmt->rowCount() > 0){
            $stmt->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
            $user = $stmt->fetchAll()[0];

            if(password_verify($password, $user['password'])){
                
                $_SESSION['user'] = $user;
                header('Location: dashboard.php');

            } else if ($password === $user['password']) {
                
                $_SESSION['user'] = $user;
                header('Location: dashboard.php');
            
            } else  {

                $error_message = 'Please make sure that username and password are correct.';

            }

        } else $error_message = 'Please make sure that username and password are correct.';
    }

This is the solution to the has crypted password
Since kimdahyun and jeongyeon has normal password not ENCRYPTED
we set else if do deal with those, as password_verify has problem dealing with those kind

It will take on the form/var? of status_count

status_count: (string) "18"
(array) [1 element]
status_count: (string) "6"
(array) [1 element]

We removed fetch_assoc into this: $row = $stmt->fetch();
which led to this result

(array) [2 elements]
status_count: (string) "18"
0: (string) "18"
(array) [2 elements]
status_count: (string) "6"
0: (string) "6"

This below line shows how much each suppliers has orderProduct or something

foreach($rows as $row){

    $row = $stmt->fetch();

    $count = $row['p_count']; 
    var_dump($count);
};

die;


The results:
string(1) "4" string(1) "3" string(1) "2"

this correlates with the supplier column in productsuppliers
Nestle has four
ChowQueen has three
Apple has two

Records every transactions - when stocks arrive

Add product quantity
- to main product table - qty
- to batch table (aggregate)

When saving, make sure the qty is set to 0
- If it is zero, we don't include in saving

Create a new table
- Connects row id to the new table
- id, order_product_id, qty arrive, data received, update

we made order_product_history at this point,
he really just doesn't follow the diagram he made


                                <td class="po_qty_received"><input class="updateInputStyle" type="number" value="'+ poList.qtyReceived +'"></td>\

$sql = "UPDATE order_product 
            SET
            quantity_received=?, status=?, quantity_remaining=?
            WHERE id =?";

you have to write or type status=? again when changing
status is its own keyword thing probably so it conflicts with system
if not set again to let the system know its a variable/column

remember that the (int) being placed might be important when database int rows/columns are in mind

nothing got left out or went wrong, let's do that later.










[Add and Manage Product Delivery Records in MySQL Database using PHP - Inventory System 34:]

We kind of skimmed this one but you can revisit this for more clarification
as to why we casually did this was because theres nothing much new introduced

So the new order_product_history makes it so whenever something is being added
it makes a mark on that table 

Also you can delete the batch things in order_product table as Its
impossible to remove outside of that table, because you now of its relations

Also you can see the stock in products table, its affected by the order received.
At this point we'll ease in our attention to this course, moving forward 
we'll be just casually getting the code and only after the course is finished
will we dive into why these codes are like this or set like this
