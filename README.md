# Inventory-Management-System
A dynamic flexible Inventory Management System composed of PHP,d

This is a project that is made up of or comprising of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, MYSQL as the main languages.
And assisting these languages are JSON, AJAX, PDO, BOOTSTRAP.

This is a website that I built which I closely based and followed from a youtube tutorial.
But unlike the website made in it, I improved and added on some code and especially on the css design.

My main concern was with how the website looked and function when moved or shrinked.
The dynamic layout I've applied has made it so the pages doesn't encounter any overflow.
