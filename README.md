# Inventory-Management-System
A dynamic flexible Inventory Management System composed of PHP,d

This is a project that is made up of or comprising of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, MYSQL as the main languages.
And assisting these languages are JSON, AJAX, PDO, BOOTSTRAP.

This is a website that I built which I closely painstakingly followed from a youtube tutorial which is more than over 22 hours of runtime.
But unlike the website built in that tutorial, I improved and added on some code and especially on the css design.
(I've left out the last six remaining videos, additions that seem redundant, although I plan on adding it in the near feature)

My main concern was with how the website looked and function when moved or shrinked.
The dynamic layout I've applied has made it so the pages doesn't encounter any overflow.
